# My Search Buddy - iOS

> **Status:** ðŸš§ Coming Soon

## Overview

The iOS version of My Search Buddy will bring powerful file search capabilities to iPhone and iPad, with a focus on:

- **Cross-cloud search** - Unified search across iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive
- **Smart file organization** - Quick access to files from multiple cloud services
- **Enhanced metadata search** - Search by file type, size, date, content
- **Native iOS integration** - Files app integration, Siri shortcuts, widgets

## Architecture

The iOS app will share the core Rust search engine (`core/finder-core`) with the macOS app, ensuring consistent performance and behavior across platforms.
